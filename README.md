## Predictive abilities comparison from multiple dynamic prediction models


This repository contains additional material for the manuscript entitled « Predictive abilities comparison from multiple dynamic prediction models » by Moreau et al.

The script « R_functions.R » contains the various R functions used to implement the comparison procedure detailed in the article. The file « base_GitHub.RData » is a simulated data set containing 3 dynamic predictions calculated for 2000 individuals at different landmark times. Finally, the script « Example.R » is an R application of our methodology on these same data (comparison test and graph of dynamic AUC trajectories).
